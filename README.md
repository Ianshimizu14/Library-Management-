# Library-Management (mySQL)
This project is a beginner/intermediate  friendly database built in mySQL that demonstrates my understanding and skill with creating and structuring data.
It models a simple library management system that can be used to track books, members, and borrowing history

# Project structure
- "Schema.sql" = SQL script that creates the database schema
- 'data.sql' = SQL script that contains sample data for testing.
- 'queries.sql' = SQL queries that demonstrate that the database works.

# Features

-Track library members and their join dates 
-Record borrowed books and their history
-Queries can show overdue books, popular books and active members

# Getting started

```sql
   SOURCE schema.sql;
   SOURCE data.sql;
